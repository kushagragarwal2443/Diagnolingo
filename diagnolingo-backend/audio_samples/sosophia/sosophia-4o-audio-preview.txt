Doctor: "Alright, Sophia, I see you've injured your knee. Tell me what happened?"
Sophia: "Yes, I was jumping on my child's trampoline, and it slipped from under me."
Doctor: "Oh dear, the big trampoline in your backyard?"
Sophia: "Yes, the big one."
Doctor: "Which knee is it?"
Sophia: "My right knee."
Doctor: "And when did this happen?"
Sophia: "Four days ago."
Doctor: "The weather was nice this weekend. It's good you got to go outside, but sorry to hear about your knee. Did you hear a pop or any sound?"
Sophia: "Yes, I heard a pop, and then it swelled up a lot."
Doctor: "Did you do anything for the pain?"
Sophia: "I took ibuprofen and applied some ice."
Doctor: "Did it help?"
Sophia: "A little, but it's still hard to walk."
Doctor: "Can you stand, or is that painful too?"
Sophia: "I can stand a bit, but it's painful."
Doctor: "Where is the pain in your knee? Inside, outside, or in the middle?"
Sophia: "It feels like it's inside."
Doctor: "Okay, as your primary care physician, I'll take a look. I see you're also being treated for diabetes. How's your diet? Is your sugar level low?"
Sophia: "It's fine, I'm not eating much."
Doctor: "How's your diet been recently?"
Sophia: "It's good."
Doctor: "It's hard to stay away from sweets. I eat ice cream myself. Let's do a physical exam. I'll check your heart rate first. Normal. Now, take a deep breath. Good. Let's look at your knee. There's definitely swelling. I'll move your knee, tell me if it hurts."
Sophia: "It hurts when you push it inward."
Doctor: "And outward?"
Sophia: "A little, but not much."
Doctor: "There's some pain on palpation inside and a little outside. If I bend your knee backward?"
Sophia: "It hurts a lot."
Doctor: "And if I straighten your leg?"
Sophia: "It still hurts."
Doctor: "Your leg's motion is limited, with pain in both flexion and extension. I'll push it a bit. It seems your McMurray test is negative. I'm concerned about your MCL, the tendon inside your knee. You have difficulty bearing weight, and you heard a pop. I'll prescribe a straight brace and Mobic for pain and swelling. Keep applying ice every hour or so. I'll also send you for an MRI to check for other injuries."
Sophia: "That sounds good, thank you."
Doctor: "For your diabetes, it seems you're managing well. I'll recheck your hemoglobin A1c and refill your Metformin prescription. Any other questions?"
Sophia: "No, thank you."
Doctor: "Okay, feel better
