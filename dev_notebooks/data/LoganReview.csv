[patient] right my left wrist and hand has been bothering me probably for a few months now with pain and numbness
[doctor] okay and you said that's been ongoing for several months do you know what caused this type of pain or is it just something that started slowly or
[patient] it just kinda started on it's own it i notice it mostly at night
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes it will i'll wake up and my hands asleep and i got ta shake it out
[doctor] shake it out and okay
[patient] and then some
[doctor] what kind of work do you do
[patient] i do yard work
[doctor] yard work
[patient] landscaping landscaping
[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out
[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand
[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left
[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that
[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips
[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side
[patient] yeah same thing
[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep
[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy
[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this
[patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it
[doctor] okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks
[patient] very good appreciate your time","CHIEF COMPLAINT

Left wrist and hand pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

George Lewis is a pleasant 57-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of left wrist and hand pain. He reports an onset of a few months ago but denies any specific injury. However, the patient notes he often engages in repetitive motions while performing his work duties. His symptoms are worse at night, and he wakes with numbness in the bilateral hands. He experiences numbness in all fingers, but states it is the most noticeable in the left thumb and index finger. He affirms intermittent numbness in the left little finger. For relief, he shakes his hands upon waking. The patient also experiences weakness in his left hand. He reports he drops objects and explains “I have a hard time feeling it.”

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient denies a history of rheumatoid arthritis.

SOCIAL HISTORY

He works in landscaping. He reports consuming 1 to 2 beers on weekends.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports left wrist and hand pain. Denies right hand pain.
Neurological: Reports numbness in bilateral hands and fingers, and left hand weakness.

PHYSICAL EXAM

NEURO: Decreased sensation in the right thumb and index finger.
MSK: Examination of the bilateral hands: Grip strength is less on the left in comparison to the right. Positive Tinel sign bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's clinical history and examination today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding treatment options for his current symptoms. I discussed the importance of activity modification and encouraged the patient to limit active repetitive motions while working for the next 2 weeks. I also recommended that he wear a wrist splint to provide increased support. I advised him to take ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours. Additionally, I recommended we obtain an EMG of the bilateral upper extremities to evaluate for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks when the EMG results are available for review. If at that time his symptoms have not improved with these conservative measures, we will discuss further treatment options including additional diagnostic testing or possible surgical intervention.

The patient states he understands and is in agreement with the plan. All questions were answered to the patient's satisfaction.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 2 weeks.","{'Subjective': {'Chief complaint': ['Numbness and tingling in left fingers', 'Pain in left wrist'], 'History of present illness': ['Symptoms have been ongoing for a few months', 'Noticed mostly at night', 'Wakes up with hands asleep, needs to shake them out', 'Weakness in left hand, difficulty feeling objects, drops things'], 'Past social history': ['Works in landscaping, involving heavy labor and repetitive movements', 'Occasional alcohol consumption (1-2 beers on weekends)']}, 'Objective': {'Vital signs': [], 'Physical exam findings': ['Weaker grip strength in left hand', ""Bilateral positive Tinel's sign"", 'Altered sensation in left thumb and pointer finger'], 'Laboratory data': [], 'Imaging results': [], 'Other diagnostic data': []}, 'Assessment': {'Diagnosis': ['Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome']}, 'Plan': {'Tests': ['Order EMG to measure electrical impulses in fingers'], 'Referrals': [], 'Medications': [{'Name': 'Ibuprofen', 'Dosage': '600 mg', 'Route': 'Oral', 'Frequency': 'Every 6 hours'}], 'Instructions': ['Activity modification: reduce repetitive motions', 'Wear wrist splint', 'Follow up in 2 weeks to reassess and consider further intervention']}, 'Codes': {'Tests': {'Order EMG to measure electrical impulses in fingers': []}, 'Medications': {'Ibuprofen, 600 mg': ['182181089', '904585361', '904585461']}, 'Diagnosis': {'Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome': ['G5603', 'G5600']}}}","Tokens used for SOAP generation: 1777, 352, 2129

[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] alright so we will see you back in a week or two and i'll have my nurse come in with that prescription and hopefully with all the treatment you'll be able to pass the stone okay alright","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Anna Diaz is a pleasant 29-year-old female who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right-sided back pain.

For approximately 1 week, the patient has been experiencing constant right-sided back pain that radiates down to her lower right side, as well as hematuria and nausea. Her primary care physician was concerned for possible kidney stones and subsequently referred her here for further evaluation. She denies any pain with urination or vomiting, but admits that she has likely not been drinking enough water. The only treatment she has tried so far is ibuprofen with minimal pain relief. Although she denies any personal history of kidney stones prior to this occurrence, she explains that her father has had kidney stones in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Constitutional: Negative for fever.
Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea. Negative for vomiting.
Genitourinary: Positive for hematuria

VITALS

Vitals are normal.
Blood pressure is normal.
Heart rate is normal.

PHYSICAL EXAM

GI/GU: Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA located near her flank with tenderness on the right.

RESULTS

CT scan of the abdomen was reviewed today and revealed a kidney stone measuring 0.5 cm in size, located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Kidney stone, right side.

PLAN

After reviewing the patient's examination and CT results, I discussed the findings with the patient. The CT scan revealed a 0.5 cm kidney stone in the proximal right ureter. I advised her to drink plenty of fluids, as much as possible, to help facilitate passing of the stone. She was provided with a urine strainer so she can see if and when the stone passes. Given that over-the-counter ibuprofen is not providing significant relief, we will send in a prescription for ibuprofen 800 mg to help with her pain. I'm also going to order a BMP, urinalysis, and a urine culture for further evaluation. Depending on the results of the urinalysis, we may need to start her on antibiotics. I want to see her back in 2 weeks. If she is still symptomatic at that time, we may need to consider further treatment such as a lithotripsy. This procedure was explained to the patient.

INSTRUCTIONS

Follow up in 2 weeks.","{'Subjective': {'Chief complaint': ['Back pain on the right side', 'Blood in urine'], 'History of present illness': ['Back pain lasting for about a week', 'Pain has moved to the right lower side', 'Constant pain', 'No pain during urination', 'Nausea but no vomiting', 'Family history of kidney stones (father)'], 'Past social history': ['First occurrence of kidney stones']}, 'Objective': {'Vital signs': ['No fever', 'Blood pressure and heart rate normal'], 'Physical exam findings': ['Mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen', 'CVA tenderness on the right', 'No rebound or guarding'], 'Laboratory data': [], 'Imaging results': ['CT scan shows a stone measuring 0.5 cm in the proximal right ureter', 'No evidence of hydronephrosis'], 'Other diagnostic data': []}, 'Assessment': {'Diagnosis': ['Kidney stone in the proximal right ureter', 'Mild kidney inflammation']}, 'Plan': {'Tests': ['BMP', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine culture'], 'Referrals': [], 'Medications': [{'Name': 'Ibuprofen', 'Dosage': '800 mg', 'Route': 'Oral', 'Frequency': 'As needed for pain'}], 'Instructions': ['Increase fluid intake to facilitate passing the stone', 'Use a strainer to collect urine to monitor for stone passage', 'Follow up in 1-2 weeks for reassessment']}, 'Codes': {'Tests': {'BMP': [], 'Urinalysis': [], 'Urine culture': []}, 'Medications': {'Ibuprofen, 800 mg': ['182181089', '904585361', '904585461']}, 'Diagnosis': {'Kidney stone in the proximal right ureter': ['N202'], 'Mild kidney inflammation': ['N/A']}}}","Tokens used for SOAP generation: 1562, 401, 1963

Kidney stones.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS

Mason Ward is a pleasant 80-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of kidney stones. The patient was referred from his primary care physician. The onset of his pain began 1 week ago when he was in his barn moving hay when he had a sudden onset of right back pain. The patient initially thought his pain was due to throwing hay; however, he broke out into a sweat and became nauseated. He was seen by his primary care physician, who ordered a CT scan and told him that he had a kidney stone. He denies having kidney stones before, but states that his father has a history of kidney stones in the past. He explains that when he had pain, which has now resolved, it would radiate almost to his groin. The patient describes the pain as intermittent after he found out it was a kidney stone. He explains that he has been straining his urine, but has not seen anything. He denies any hematuria.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right back pain.

VITALS

Vitals look good, blood pressure and hear rate are within normal limits. Temperature is within normal limits.

PHYSICAL EXAM

MSK: Examination of the abdomen: No pain with palpation of the abdomen. No rebound or guarding. There is CVA tenderness on the right side.

RESULTS

The CT scan of the abdomen revealed a stone that is measuring 0.5 cm located in the proximal right ureter. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis.

ASSESSMENT

Right kidney stone.

PLAN

We reviewed the patient's CT results in detail today. I have recommended that we treat the patient conservatively. I have prescribed the patient oxycodone 5 mg every 6 to 8 hours for pain. He may continue to take Tylenol between the oxycodone doses for any breakthrough pain. The patient should continue to use the strainer when he urinates until the stone passes. I have also recommended that we obtain a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to evaluate for any signs of infection.

INSTRUCTIONS

The patient will follow up with me in 1 to 2 weeks to check on his progress. If his symptoms have not improved, we will discuss further treatment options including lithotripsy.","{'Subjective': {'Chief complaint': ['Evaluation of kidney stones'], 'History of present illness': ['Sudden onset of right back pain about a week ago while working with horses', 'Pain radiated to the groin but not completely', 'Nausea and sweating during the episode', 'No current pain, but had intermittent pain after diagnosis', 'Straining urine with no visible stones or blood'], 'Past social history': ['No previous history of kidney stones', 'Family history of kidney stones (father)']}, 'Objective': {'Vital signs': ['Blood pressure and heart rate normal', 'No fever'], 'Physical exam findings': ['Tenderness on the right side (CVA tenderness)', 'No abdominal tenderness, rebound, or guarding'], 'Laboratory data': ['CT scan shows a 0.5 cm stone in the proximal right ureter', 'No evidence of hydronephrosis'], 'Imaging results': [], 'Other diagnostic data': []}, 'Assessment': {'Diagnosis': ['Kidney stone in proximal right ureter', 'No hydronephrosis']}, 'Plan': {'Tests': ['BMP', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine culture'], 'Referrals': [], 'Medications': [{'Name': 'Oxycodone', 'Dosage': '5 mg', 'Route': 'Oral', 'Frequency': 'Every 6 to 8 hours'}], 'Instructions': ['Push fluids to facilitate stone passage', 'Continue using urine strainer', 'Follow up in 1-2 weeks to reassess']}, 'Codes': {'Tests': {'BMP': [], 'Urinalysis': [], 'Urine culture': []}, 'Medications': {'Oxycodone, 5 mg': ['54368663', '66591091332']}, 'Diagnosis': {'Kidney stone in proximal right ureter': ['N202'], 'No hydronephrosis': ['N/A']}}}","Tokens used for SOAP generation: 1400, 407, 1807

Right knee pain.

MEDICAL HISTORY

The patient has a history of diabetes. She has been doing pretty good with her diet. She states that she forgets to check her sugars quite a bit.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS

Musculoskeletal: Reports right knee pain and swelling.

PHYSICAL EXAM

Respiratory
- Auscultation of Lungs: Clear bilaterally.

Cardiovascular
No murmurs, gallops.

Musculoskeletal
- Examination of the right knee: Some swelling present.
- Palpation: Some pain to palpation on the medial aspect of the right knee, and a little bit of pain on the lateral aspect of the right knee.
- Range of Motion: Limited range of motion as well as pain on both flexion and extension of the knee.
- Special Testing:
McMurray's Test: Negative.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

1. Right knee pain.
- Medical Reasoning: I am concerned about a torn MCL due to pain on ambulation and trouble with weightbearing, as well as the pop she heard.
- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today including bracing, anti-inflammatories, and icing. - Medical Treatment: I am going to put her in a straight leg brace and I will prescribe some Mobic. She can start taking that as a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down. I want her to ice her knee once an hour for about 15 minutes.
- Additional Testing: I am also going to send her out for an MRI.

2. Type 2 diabetes.
- Medical Reasoning: The patient states that her type 2 diabetes are well-managed.
- Medical Treatment: I am also going to get a refill on the metformin that she has been taking 500 mg.
- Additional Testing: We are going to recheck her hemoglobin A1c.
