Speaker 1: Hi, good to see you. I was reading your appointment notes and it seems you have kidney stones. I saw this in your PSP, and you still have one. That's why they asked you to come in today, right? How's it going?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I have back pain on the right side, and it's been going on for about a week.

Speaker 1: Okay. And you mentioned seeing blood in your urine?

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: So, the pain is on your right side. Does it move around or stay in one place?

Speaker 2: It moves a bit lower on the right side.

Speaker 1: How would you describe the pain? Is it constant or does it come and go?

Speaker 2: It's almost always constant.

Speaker 1: Do you feel pain when you urinate? I know you mentioned blood, but is there pain too?

Speaker 2: No, not really.

Speaker 1: Have you taken any medication, like Azo or anything?

Speaker 2: I took some ibuprofen, which helped a bit.

Speaker 1: But you still feel pain even after taking ibuprofen?

Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: Have you experienced nausea, vomiting, or fever?

Speaker 2: No vomiting, but a bit of nausea.

Speaker 1: Do others in your family have kidney stones?

Speaker 2: Yes, my father had them. I think he passed some in his urine.

Speaker 1: Is this your first time having kidney stones?

Speaker 2: Yes, it's my first time.

Speaker 1: Let's do an exam. How was your Easter break?

Speaker 2: It was okay, but I had some pain over the weekend. I told my pediatrician, and they sent me here.

Speaker 1: I guess you didn't participate much in Easter egg hunts?

Speaker 2: Not much, but I did open a few eggs.

Speaker 1: I was lucky; my friends had an adult Easter egg hunt. I found a few eggs myself. Let's do a physical exam. Your vitals look good, no fever, blood pressure, heart rate, all fine. Does it hurt when I press on your abdomen?

Speaker 2: A little.

Speaker 1: Mild pain in your abdomen, a bit soft, some palpitation, no rebound or guarding, CVA tenderness on the right. This indicates some inflammation of your kidney. We'll do a CT scan of your right side. It shows a 5mm stone near your right ureter, moving from your kidney to your bladder. No hydronephrosis, so no obstruction or swelling in your kidney, which is good. Let's discuss the plan. Since you have a kidney stone on your right side, I want you to increase your fluid intake to help pass the stone. Are you drinking a lot of water?

Speaker 2: Maybe not enough, but a bit.

Speaker 1: I want you to drink as much water as you can. We'll keep you hydrated and try to pass the stone. I'll prescribe ibuprofen, 800mg, for your pain. Use it when you feel pain while moving. I'll also give you a strainer to use when you urinate, so we can see if the stone passes. I'll book a BMP, urinalysis, and urine culture to check if we need to put you on antibiotics in case of infection. I want to see you again in a week or two. If you have symptoms, we can discuss further options like lithotripsy, a minimally invasive procedure using shock waves to break the stone. Any other questions?

Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.

Speaker 1: Okay, I'll see you in a week or two. I'll ask my nurse to bring the prescription, and hopefully, your kidney stone will pass. Take care
